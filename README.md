# CronOS - Modular Firmware / OS for Arduino Based Nerf Blasters

Currently this is in beta status...

We are going to need better documentation, but for now all of the confifuration is done in "include/CronOS.h".

"CronOS.h" is fairly well commented, so it should be easy to figure out what settings you need to change.

Notes:

1. The stock solenoid spring is too weak, i replaced it with a spring from a ball point pen.

2. I had to supply direct power from the blaster's battery to the solenoid in order for it
   to have enough power to compress the new spring. The solenoid is only active for around
   100ms per cycle, so it doesn't see power for very long. there appears to be no adverse 
   effects from doing this.
